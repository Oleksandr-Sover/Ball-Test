# Ball Test

### Sample tests-tasks for junior C# Unity developers
The theme of the test task is a game in which you need to destroy the balls when you hit them. Whoever destroys the balls more will get more points. When the ball goes beyond the bottom of the screen, the game ends.

SOLID, DRY and KIISS principles are applied in this project.
